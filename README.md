# AI Component Generator

Welcome to the **AI React Component Designer** frontend repository! This project is a web application that allows users to design React components such as buttons, forms, and other UI elements. You can preview, style, and adjust your components in real-time. The frontend connects to a Flask-based Python backend, which handles API calls to the OpenAI API for AI-driven component generation.
